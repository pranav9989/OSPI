📍 What Does Region = 1 Mean?
Region 1 (and others like 2–9) do not correspond to specific countries or states — these are anonymized categorical codes for different geographical regions.

They may represent different continents, countries, or market segments based on the dataset's internal logic, but the exact mapping is not publicly available.
