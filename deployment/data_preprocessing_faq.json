  },
  {
    "question": "Can you summarize the entire preprocessing pipeline?",
    "answer": "Sure! We cleaned and transformed the dataset by encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, applied cyclical transformation to the 'Month' column, log-transformed skewed numerical features, removed redundant columns, handled outliers using the IQR method, converted boolean values to integers, balanced the dataset using SMOTE, and scaled the numerical features using StandardScaler."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the dataset balanced or imbalanced?",
    "answer": "The original dataset was imbalanced with fewer positive 'Revenue' cases. We applied SMOTE to balance the class distribution in the training data."

    "question": "Can you provide a link to the dataset?",
    "answer": "Yes! The dataset is available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why did you cyclically transform the 'Month' column instead of label encoding it?",
    "answer": "Cyclical transformation (using sine and cosine) preserves the fact that months have a circular relationship — December is close to January. Label encoding would introduce a false ordinal relationship between months."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the final model-ready features after preprocessing?",
    "answer": "After preprocessing, we used 29 features, including transformed numerical columns, one-hot encoded categorical columns, and engineered cyclical features for 'Month'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which columns were dropped during preprocessing?",
    "answer": "We dropped 'Informational' and 'Informational_Duration' as they didn’t contribute significantly to model performance and were redundant."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did you handle missing data?",
    "answer": "The dataset did not contain missing values, so no imputation or removal was needed during preprocessing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is data preprocessing important?",
    "answer": "Preprocessing prepares raw data for modeling by cleaning, transforming, and structuring it in a way that enhances model performance, ensures consistency, and handles issues like skewness, imbalance, and categorical variables."

    "answer": "Yes, the fitted preprocessor is saved using `joblib.dump` to a file named 'preprocessor.pkl'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What library is used to save the preprocessing pipeline?",
    "answer": "`joblib` is used to save the preprocessing pipeline."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of using SMOTE?",
    "answer": "SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset and improve model training."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to apply the same preprocessing to test data?",
    "answer": "Applying the same preprocessing ensures that the test data is scaled in the same way as the training data, maintaining consistency for model predictions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which model achieved the highest test accuracy?",
    "answer": "The Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost both achieved the highest test accuracy of 0.90 (89.73% for XGBoost and 89.62% for Random Forest)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which model shows signs of overfitting?",

    "answer": "The 'TrafficType' column contains numeric codes representing different types of traffic sources (e.g., direct, referral, search engines). The dataset uses numeric values (e.g., 1 to 20) as anonymous identifiers for each traffic source category. The exact names are not disclosed in the dataset."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the 'Browser' column numeric instead of showing browser names like 'Chrome' or 'Firefox'?",
    "answer": "The 'Browser' column uses numeric codes to represent different web browsers. This is a common approach in anonymized datasets to reduce complexity or avoid naming specific technologies. Each number corresponds to a unique browser, but exact names are not included."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are the 'OperatingSystems' shown as numbers rather than names like 'Windows' or 'MacOS'?",
    "answer": "The 'OperatingSystems' column is encoded using numeric values (1 to 8+), with each number representing a specific operating system. The dataset does not include exact names for these values to maintain generalization and anonymity."
